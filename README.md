# Bellman-Ford-Pnp2023

This is a repository for implementing the Bellman-Ford algorithm (and maybe other graph algorithms) in Lean4. This is done as a part of a course project for [Proofs and Programs 2023](http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/proofs-and-programs-2023/).

## Goal

The goal for this project is to implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm. After this, adding implementations for other graph-based algorithms (like improvements to Bellman-Ford, such as the Shorter Path Faster algorithm) would be ideal.

## References

The Bellman-Ford algorithm was concieved by Richard Bellman and Lester Ford in [1958](https://www.ams.org/journals/qam/1958-16-01/S0033-569X-1958-0102435-2/) and [1956](https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P923.html) respectively.

We are using a graph library for Lean4, available [here](https://github.com/goens/graph-library-for-lean4), as a part of our existing code.
